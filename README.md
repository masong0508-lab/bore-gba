# BORE (tech demo)

GBA voxel creature creator, the seed of a later life sim. Pseudo-3D isometric view, humanoid-friendly build space:
**6 wide × 4 long × 8 high** blocks. Parts: HEAD, TORSO, ARM, LEG, EYE, MOUTH, EAR, HAIR, each in 3 sizes (S/M/L = 1×/2×/3× blocks).

## Controls
| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| D-pad | move cursor (left/right = X, up/down = Z) |
| L / R | cursor down / up |
| A / B | place / erase part |
| Start | cycle size S, M, L |
| Select (tap) | next part |
| Select + L/R | previous / next part |
| Select + Left/Right | turn the view 90° (D-pad then moves relative to the screen) |
| Select + A / B | cycle skin / hair colour (recolours everything) |

Arm, leg, eye and ear are mirrored automatically across the body.

## Build
Push to GitHub: the **Build GBA ROM** workflow produces `bore.gba` as an artifact (tag a commit to get it as a release).
Locally with devkitARM installed: `make`. Run in mGBA or on hardware.
